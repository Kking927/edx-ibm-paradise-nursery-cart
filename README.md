# IBM edX Paradise Nursery Cart Project

This project is a **shopping cart application** developed as part of the **IBM edX course**.  
It allows users to:

- Browse nursery products  
- Add items to a shopping cart  
- View, update, or remove selected items  

The app provides a clean and interactive interface for managing product selections, making it a great demonstration of React and JavaScript skills in a real-world e-commerce scenario.
